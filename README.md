# Welcome 

In this repo you will find some example material which aims to get you 
started with F#. 

### Disclaimer

Just by going through these files are not going to be an F# expert. 

### Inspiration

I have been greatly inspired by my own road to learn F# and the 
functional programming paradigm in general.

I'd also like to mention [Ben Gobeil](github.com/bengobeil) 
as his material has helped - is still helping - me to learn F#.
